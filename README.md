# MERN Expense Tracker

This is a minimal MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) scaffold for a personal expense tracker.
Features:

- Add / Edit / Delete expenses
- Categorize expenses
- Monthly summary (category-wise) using aggregation

See `server/README.md` and `client/README.md` for running instructions.

## Notes

- Update `server/.env.example` -> `.env` with your MongoDB connection string.
- On the client, you can set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to point to deployed backend.
